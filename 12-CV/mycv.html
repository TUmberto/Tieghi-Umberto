    1) Laying out your divs
First, you'll want to create four <div>s: one for the header, one for the left column, one for the right column, and one for the footer.

Instructions
On the HTML tab, create four <div>s: one with an ID of "header", one with a class of "left", one with a class of "right", and one with an ID of "footer".

On the CSS tab, give all your divs whatever styling you like! We recommend giving them all a border-radius of 5px for that rounded corner look.
    
    2) Sizing and color
Good! Now let's add dimensions and color to our <div>s so we can see them.

You can give the sections of your resume any sizing or color you like—feel free to look back at the first exercise in this project to see what sizing we used.

Instructions
Give your <div>s a height, width, and background color!
    
    3) Fixing your header
Great work!

Now it's time to fix your header—literally—so it stays put on the page as people reading your resume scroll down.

If you read the first exercise's CSS carefully, you'll see we've snuck in a little trick for you: the z-index property. You can think of the z-index as a measure of importance: the higher an element's z-index, the higher it will be "stacked" on the page. Giving your header a z-index of 1 while not giving any of the other elements a z-index ensures that your header will sit "on top of" your other elements and won't get stuck behind them.

Instructions
Give your #header a position of fixed and a z-index of 1.
    
    4) Floating left and right
Excellent! Now your readers will always be able to see your header.

Next up: float your columns to the proper sides!

Instructions
Float the div with a class of .left to the left and the div with a class of .right to the right.
    
    5) Clearing the footer
Great! Now we just need to make sure our footer clears the left and right columns (that is, sits below them on the page).

Instructions
Set your #footer's clear property to both.
    
    6) Headings, paragraphs, and lists
Finally, let's add the content of our resume: headers to describe experience, skills, and education, paragraphs to add details, and lists to... well, make lists!

Instructions
Include any combination of headers (any kind: h1 through h6), paragraphs, and lists (ordered or unordered) you'd like. Just be sure to include at least one header, one paragraph, and one list.
    
    7) Victory!
Great work! You've created your resume using HTML and CSS. You've come a long way since you first started!

Go ahead and make any additional changes you'd like: add or remove columns, reshape <div>s (you can experiment with border-radius), switch up colors, change font type, and so on.
